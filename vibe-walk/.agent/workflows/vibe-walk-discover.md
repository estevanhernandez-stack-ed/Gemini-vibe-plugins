description: "Run when the user says `/vibe-walk-discover` (or the router hands off after bootstrap). Phase 1 autonomous discovery for vibe-walk: reads the target app's orientation docs, route surface, and component composition to produce a surface inventory, anchor-readiness verdict, ranked stop shortlist, named aha-moment candidate, and — most importantly — the build/don't-build/cheaper-first verdict. Runs entirely without asking the user anything. Writes output to .vibe-walk/discovery.json."

# /vibe-walk-discover — Phase 1 autonomous discovery

Sherpa persona, posture, and hard rules are always-on via `AGENTS.md`. The build conventions (D1–D6) and the don't-build conditions are in the `vibe-walk-guide` skill (`.agent/skills/vibe-walk-guide/SKILL.md`) — load it when you reach the verdict. Then follow this workflow.

## What this command does

Phase 1 runs entirely on the codebase. No questions until the verdict is in.

The goal: earn the right to build a tour — or surface an honest "don't build one here."

```
inventory_surfaces → anchor_readiness → build_verdict
       ↓                   ↓                  ↓
  surface list         readiness         verdict + reasons
  + count              + risk flags      (first-class output)
       ↓
  rank stops → name aha-moment → present to builder
```

## Execution procedure

### 1. Session start

Invoke `vibe-walk-session-logger.start("discover", project_dir_basename)`. Store the returned `sessionUUID` — it pairs with the terminal entry and any friction log entries.

### 2. Locate the target app

Read `.vibe-walk/config.json` for `app_path` (set by bootstrap). If absent, ask:

```
I need the path to the app you want to tour. Absolute path or relative to here?
```

### 3. Run inventory_surfaces

```python
from discovery.inventory_surfaces import inventory
result = inventory(app_path)
```

Produces:
- `product_summary` — 1–4 sentence description from the app's orientation docs.
- `surfaces` — list of `{name, file, purpose, view}`.
- `interactive_surface_count` — integer.

If `inventory()` returns an `error` key, stop and surface the error to the builder. Do not continue with partial data.

### 4. Run anchor_readiness

```python
from discovery.anchor_readiness import assess
readiness_result = assess(app_path)
```

Produces:
- `readiness` — `"ready"` | `"needs-pass"` | `"none"`.
- `risk_flags` — list of detected risk signals.

### 5. Run build_verdict

Map the inventory + readiness outputs to the verdict signals dict:

```python
from discovery.build_verdict import decide_verdict

signals = {
    "interactive_surface_count": result["interactive_surface_count"],
    "audience":                  _infer_audience(result["product_summary"]),
    "existing_tour":             _has_existing_tour(app_path),
    "existing_intro_flow":       _has_existing_intro_flow(app_path),
    "app_category":              _infer_app_category(result["product_summary"], app_path),
    "anchor_readiness":          readiness_result["readiness"],
    "no_stable_selectors":       "no_stable_selectors" in readiness_result["risk_flags"],
    "anchor_pass_refused":       False,  # not known yet; can be overridden by builder
    "first_run_is_blank_canvas": _detect_blank_canvas(app_path, result),
    "high_urgency":              _infer_high_urgency(result["product_summary"]),
    "untourable_surface_ratio":  _calc_untourable_ratio(readiness_result),
}

verdict_result = decide_verdict(signals)
```

**Signal inference helpers (inline in the SKILL execution, not separate scripts):**

- `_infer_audience` — scan product_summary for keywords: "expert", "power user", "admin", "developer", "engineer", "analyst" → `"domain_expert"`; "B2B", "team", "enterprise" → `"b2b"`; else `"b2c"`.
- `_has_existing_tour` — scan app_path for files matching `*tour*`, `*spotlight*`, `*coachmark*`, `*walkthrough*` (case-insensitive), OR `package.json` containing tour library names (`driver.js`, `shepherd.js`, `react-joyride`, `intro.js`, `reactour`). Skip directories: `node_modules`, `.git`, `.agent`. If found → `True` (sets `existing_tour` → fires don't-build Condition 3). **Do NOT match on `*onboard*`, `*welcome*`, `*guide*`, `*intro*`, `*flyby*` — those are signup/intro flows that are complementary to a tour, not redundant.**
- `_has_existing_intro_flow` — scan app_path for files matching `*onboard*`, `*welcome*`, `*intro*`, `*guide*`, `*flyby*` (case-insensitive). Skip directories: `node_modules`, `.git`, `.agent`. If found → `True` (sets `existing_intro_flow` — used by the walk phase for trigger sequencing, NOT a don't-build signal). **Example: Celestia3's `OnboardingExperience.tsx` + `WelcomeModal.tsx` → `existing_intro_flow=True`, `existing_tour=False` → verdict is still `build`.**
- `_infer_app_category` — "CLI", "command-line", "terminal" in summary → `"cli"`; "calculator", "converter", "generator" + single page → `"single_purpose"`; else `"web_app"`.
- `_detect_blank_canvas` — surface list contains a canvas/whiteboard/drawing surface AND no data-seeded content found → `True`.
- `_infer_high_urgency` — "emergency", "incident", "real-time alert", "critical" in summary → `True`.
- `_calc_untourable_ratio` — count shadow_dom + cross_origin_iframe flags; divide by total surface count. If either flag present and < 5 surfaces → 0.6.

### 6. Rank candidate stops

From the surface list, select 8–12 stops ranked by **centrality-to-first-success**:

1. **Step 1 candidate** = the surface most directly tied to the aha moment (the single action that makes a new user say "this is worth it"). Pick the most-linked-to action surface (look for `button`, `form`, or primary CTA in the file).
2. **Rank remaining surfaces** by:
   - Is it on the critical first-run path? (pages/components loaded on first login)
   - Does it have interactive elements? (buttons, forms, inputs)
   - Is it page-level vs component-level? (prefer pages for early steps)
   - Does its name suggest value delivery? (chart, dashboard, report, export, share)

Prune surfaces that are navigation-only (header/footer with no unique CTA), utility helpers, or loading states. Cap the shortlist at 12.

### 7. Name the aha-moment candidate

State it explicitly:

```
Aha-moment candidate: <ComponentName> — <one sentence why this is the first-success moment>
```

This becomes the tour's **emotional payoff stop**. Its placement depends on tour length:
- **<= 3 stops**: aha-moment is step 1 (immediate payoff — short tours benefit from it).
- **4-5 stops**: aha-moment is placed near the END (earned-payoff arc — build context first).

The Phase 1.5 Gate 4 confirms this placement with the builder.

### 8. Write discovery.json

Write to `.vibe-walk/discovery.json` (create `.vibe-walk/` if absent):

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "timestamp": "<ISO 8601>",
  "app_path": "<absolute path>",
  "product_summary": "<from inventory>",
  "surfaces": [...],
  "interactive_surface_count": <int>,
  "anchor_readiness": {
    "readiness": "<ready|needs-pass|none>",
    "risk_flags": [...]
  },
  "ranked_shortlist": [
    {"name": "<surface name>", "file": "<path>", "rank_reason": "<why>"}
  ],
  "aha_moment": {
    "surface": "<name>",
    "reason": "<one sentence>"
  },
  "verdict": "<build|don't-build|cheaper-first>",
  "verdict_reasons": [...]
}
```

### 9. Present the verdict

**The verdict is first-class.** Present it with the same weight whether it's "build" or "don't-build." Never bury it.

#### Format — "build"

```
Verdict: BUILD A TOUR

App: <product_summary — first sentence>
Surfaces: <N> interactive surfaces found.
Anchor readiness: <ready|needs-pass|none> (<risk flags if any>)

Aha-moment candidate: <name> — <reason>

Ranked stop shortlist (<N> candidates):
  1. <name> — <rank_reason>
  2. <name> — <rank_reason>
  ...

Next: /vibe-walk-walk — run the 5 interview gates and build the tour.
```

#### Format — "don't-build"

```
Verdict: DON'T BUILD A TOUR HERE

<reason 1>
<reason 2>
...

A spotlight tour layered on this app is unlikely to help — and may actively
train users to dismiss future guidance.

Next options:
  - Address the blocking condition(s) above, then re-run /vibe-walk-discover --refresh.
  - Or accept the verdict and invest elsewhere.
```

#### Format — "cheaper-first"

```
Verdict: DO SOMETHING CHEAPER FIRST

<reason>

Recommended: add empty-state design or sample-data seeding before building a tour.
The blank-canvas first-run problem (Linear/Supabase pattern) has higher ROI than
a spotlight tour when users have nothing to react to yet.

Once the first-run experience is populated, re-run /vibe-walk-discover --refresh
to get a fresh verdict.
```

### 10. Friction-logger triggers

Invoke `vibe-walk-friction-logger.log()` if:

- **Builder overrides the verdict** (e.g., "I know it says don't-build, but let's build anyway"):
  - `friction_type: "verdict_overridden"`, `confidence: "high"`
  - `symptom`: "Agent verdict was <X>, builder chose to proceed with build."
  - This is the **highest-signal friction event** in the plugin — the differentiator being ignored.

- **Builder rejects the ranked shortlist wholesale** ("none of these stops are right"):
  - `friction_type: "shortlist_rejected"`, `confidence: "medium"`

### 11. Session end

Invoke `vibe-walk-session-logger.end()` with:
- `sessionUUID` from step 1
- `outcome`: `"completed"` | `"abandoned"` | `"error"`
- `verdict`: the verdict string
- `key_decisions`: `["verdict: <X>", "aha: <surface name>", "<N> candidate stops ranked"]`
- `user_pushback`: `true` if the builder overrode the verdict or shortlist
- `friction_notes`: array of any friction signals captured
- `tour_built`: `false` (discovery never builds)
- `anchor_review_needed`: `null`

## Hard rules

- **Phase 1 asks nothing.** The five interview gates (mode, trigger, substrate, aha, role) are Phase 1.5. Don't ask them here.
- **Present the verdict first, always.** Don't bury it after the surface list.
- **Don't nudge toward "build."** A don't-build verdict is a success — it saved the builder from wasted work.
- **If inventory() errors, stop.** Partial data produces a meaningless verdict.
- **discovery.json is authoritative.** The bare router reads it to determine next step. Write it completely before presenting output.
